Extract from NPX
==============
Converts continuous data from raw NPX format (75% compression ratio) to .dat files required for spike sorting and other downstream analysis.

Reads event times from the NPX file and writes them as .npy files.

Converts the settings.xml file for an experiment into a JSON file with parameters such as sample rate and bit volts for each channel.

Dependencies
-------------
The NpxExtractor executable (Windows only) can be found [here](https://github.com/open-ephys-GUI-binaries/open-ephys/tree/neuropix/Tools/NpxExtractor).

Running
-------
```
python -m ecephys_spike_sorting.modules.extract_from_npx --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
Two arguments must be included:
1. The location of an existing file in JSON format containing a list of paths and parameters.
2. The location to write a file in JSON format containing information generated by the module while it was run.

See the `_schemas.py` file for detailed information about the contents of the input JSON.

Input data
----------
- **NPX file** : Written by Open Ephys (https://github.com/open-ephys-gui-binaries/open-ephys/tree/neuropix). Contains all of the data recorded from one or more Neuropixels probes.
- **settings.xml** : Written by Open Ephys. Contains information about the signal chain that was used for the experiment.


Output data
-----------
- **continuous.dat** : Continuous data (1 file each for LFP and AP band)
- **lfp_timestamps.npy** : Timestamps for LFP samples
- **ap_timestamps.npy** : Timestamps for AP samples
- **channel_states.npy** : Channels on which each event was recording
- **event_timestamps.npy** : Timestamps for each event
- **open-ephys.json** : Parameters for data acquistion.
